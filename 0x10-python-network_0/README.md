HTTP and URL Basics
What is a URL?
A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a reference or address used to access resources on the internet. It consists of several components, including the scheme, domain name, path, query string, and fragment.

What is HTTP?
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for transmitting data over the internet. It is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web.

How to Read a URL
A URL is read from left to right, with each component separated by specific delimiters such as colons, slashes, and question marks.

The Scheme for an HTTP URL
The scheme in an HTTP URL specifies the protocol to be used, such as "http://" or "https://".

What is a Domain Name?
A domain name is a human-readable label used to identify a specific location on the internet. It typically corresponds to the IP address of a web server.

What is a Sub-Domain?
A sub-domain is a domain that is part of a larger domain. For example, in "sub.example.com," "sub" is the sub-domain of "example.com."

How to Define a Port Number in a URL
A port number can be defined in a URL by appending it after the domain name using a colon, e.g., "http://example.com:8080."

What is a Query String?
A query string is a part of a URL that contains data to be passed to the web server as key-value pairs. It follows a question mark and can include multiple parameters.

What is an HTTP Request?
An HTTP request is a message sent by a client (usually a web browser) to a web server, requesting a specific action or resource. It includes a request method, headers, and, optionally, a message body.

What is an HTTP Response?
An HTTP response is a message sent by a web server in response to an HTTP request. It contains data, headers, and a status code indicating the result of the request.

What are HTTP Headers?
HTTP headers are metadata associated with an HTTP request or response. They provide additional information about the request or response, such as content type, encoding, and cookies.

What is the HTTP Message Body?
The HTTP message body contains the actual data being transmitted in an HTTP request or response. For example, in an HTTP POST request, the message body may contain form data or a JSON payload.
